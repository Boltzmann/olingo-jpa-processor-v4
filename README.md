# OlingoV4JPA

This project shall fill the gap between Olingo V4 and the database, by providing a JPA processor. The processor convertes JPA metadata into OData metadata and, as of now, converts GET requests into SQL queries. 
An introduction can be found in the [WIki](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/D023143/OlingoV4JPA/wiki)
