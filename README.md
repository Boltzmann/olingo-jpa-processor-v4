This project shall fill the gap between Olingo V4 and the database, by providing a JPA processor. The processor convertes JPA metadata into OData metadata and, as of now, converts GET requests into SQL queries. 
An introduction can be found in the [Tutorial](/jpa-tutorial/Tutorials/Introduction/Introduction.md)
