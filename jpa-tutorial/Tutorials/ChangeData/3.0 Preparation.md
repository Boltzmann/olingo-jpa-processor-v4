# 3.0 Preparation
We have created metadata and have seen how we can retrieve information from the database. The next peace in our puzzle is to modify the data. JPAODataGetHandler is by purpose not able to handle those request. This can be done with JPAODataCRUDHandler.
Before we start, we need to do some preparation steps. First we need a tool to make integration tests. This could be e.g. Postman for Google Chrome, which is used her, or an compatible tool like HttpRequest for Firefox.
When we make changes, we need also some logic therefore we want to create a new package _tutorial.modify_ which will be the container for the corresponding classes. Last, but not least we switch the service implementation to JPAODataCRUDHandler, so that it looks as follows:

```Java
package tutorial.service;

import java.io.IOException;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import org.apache.olingo.commons.api.ex.ODataException;
import com.sap.olingo.jpa.processor.core.api.JPAODataGetHandler;

public class Servlet extends HttpServlet {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private static final String PUNIT_NAME = "Tutorial";

	protected void service(final HttpServletRequest req, final HttpServletResponse resp)
			throws ServletException, IOException {
		try {
		
			JPAODataCRUDHandler handler = new JPAODataCRUDHandler(PUNIT_NAME,
					DataSourceHelper.createDataSource(DataSourceHelper.DB_HSQLDB));

			handler.process(req, resp);
		} catch (RuntimeException e) {
			throw new ServletException(e);
		} catch (ODataException e) {
			throw new ServletException(e);
		}
	}
}
```
With this, we can start to implement a create service: [Tutorial 3.1: Creating Entities](3.1 Creating Entities.md)
